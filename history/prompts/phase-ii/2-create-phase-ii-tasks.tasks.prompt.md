## Prompt

```text
Phase: II — Full-Stack Web Todo Application

Read the existing speckit.constitution
and the Phase II specification generated by /specify.

Create detailed implementation tasks for the system.

Include:

1. Project Setup Tasks (P2-T-001 to P2-T-008)
2. Backend Infrastructure Tasks (P2-T-009 to P2-T-016)
3. User Story 1 Tasks (P2-T-017 to P2-T-026) - Web-Based Todo Management
4. User Story 2 Tasks (P2-T-027 to P2-T-038) - Todo CRUD Operations
5. User Story 3 Tasks (P2-T-039 to P2-T-047) - Data Persistence & Reliability
6. User Story 4 Tasks (P2-T-048 to P2-T-054) - Responsive Web Experience
7. Error Handling Tasks (P2-T-055 to P2-T-061)
8. Testing Tasks (P2-T-062 to P2-T-069)
9. Constitution Compliance Tasks (P2-T-070 to P2-T-077)

Each task must be atomic and implementable with specific file paths.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive task breakdown for Phase II Full-Stack Web Todo Application with 77 specific, implementable tasks organized across 9 phases: Setup, Foundational, User Stories 1-4, Error Handling, Testing, and Constitution Compliance. Each task follows the required format with IDs, story labels, and specific file paths to enable parallel development and independent testing of user stories.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with all required functionality covered
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/phase-ii/tasks.md with 77 atomic tasks
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation using the task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks are atomic and traceable to specification requirements

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation following the task breakdown
