## Prompt

```text
Phase: II — Full-Stack Web Todo Application

Read the existing speckit.constitution
and the Phase II specification generated by /specify.

Create a detailed implementation plan describing HOW the system will be built.

Include:

# Evolution of Todo — Phase II Architecture & Design

## Document Purpose
This architecture document defines **HOW** the Phase II Full-Stack Web Todo Application will be constructed. It translates the specification's requirements into concrete architectural decisions, design patterns, and system structures. This document does not contain code or task breakdowns—those belong in the implementation phase.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Phase II Full-Stack Web Todo Application with research document and task breakdown. The plan includes technology stack decisions (Next.js 16, FastAPI 0.115+, Neon PostgreSQL), architectural patterns (clean architecture with separation of concerns), and a detailed task breakdown organized by user stories for independent implementation and testing.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete architecture and implementation plan with all required components
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/phase-ii/plan.md, specs/phase-ii/research.md, specs/phase-ii/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Begin implementation using task breakdown
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan follows constitution requirements and enables parallel development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation following the task breakdown
